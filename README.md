# SAP Sybase backup automation

 This is a windows and sybase script for taking backup of your Sybase DB, this script takes your DB backup in TSM (Tivoli server manager) tapes.

 In order to run this script you need to place it on DB server and change some of the inner content of the script such as <DBSID> and <Paths>.

 Once all modification's are done according to your database you need ti excute the .bat file and the backup process will start

 ALL the backup logs are written in to log folder change its location in backup script and you can view the backup status and completion.
